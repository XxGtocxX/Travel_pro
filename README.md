# Travel Pro Environment

An OpenEnv-compliant environment for simulating real-world travel booking tasks. It features three complexity levels to test agent autonomy, constraint adherence, and resilience to dynamic data.

## Features
- **Real-world Simulation**: Search and book flights/hotels using a realistic travel database.
- **OpenEnv Spec Compliant**: Implements the full interface with typed Pydantic models and standard step signatures.
- **3 Challenge Levels**:
  - **Level 1 (Happy Path)**: Baseline booking with high availability.
  - **Level 2 (Adversarial)**: Hotel strikes and flight crunches with strict user constraints (e.g., 4+ star ratings).
  - **Level 3 (Chaos)**: Dynamic price updates every step, requiring "stale data" handling.

## Quick Start
1. **Set up Environment**:
   ```bash
   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:.
   ```
2. **Run Baseline Evaluation**:
   ```bash
   python3 travel_pro/test_agent.py --level 1 --key [YOUR_API_KEY]
   ```

## Graders
The environment includes 3 programmatic graders:
1. `EfficiencyGrader`: Scores base on step count optimization.
2. `BudgetOptimizationGrader`: Scores based on cost-effective booking.
3. `ConstraintGrader`: Validates adherence to hotel ratings and flight types.

## Reward Function
- **Efficiency Penalty**: -0.05 per step to encourage fast completion.
- **Success Reward**: +1.0 for a successful multi-item itinerary.
- **Constraint Violations**: Deductions for failing to meet user requirements (e.g., booking a low-rated hotel).

The client uses WebSocket connections for:
- **Lower latency**: No HTTP connection overhead per request
- **Persistent session**: Server maintains your environment state
- **Efficient for episodes**: Better for many sequential steps

### Concurrent WebSocket Sessions

The server supports multiple concurrent WebSocket connections. To enable this,
modify `server/app.py` to use factory mode:

```python
# In server/app.py - use factory mode for concurrent sessions
app = create_app(
    TravelProEnvironment,  # Pass class, not instance
    TravelProAction,
    TravelProObservation,
    max_concurrent_envs=4,  # Allow 4 concurrent sessions
)
```

Then multiple clients can connect simultaneously:

```python
from travel_pro import TravelProAction, TravelProEnv
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def run_episode(client_id: int):
    with TravelProEnv(base_url="http://localhost:8000") as env:
        result = env.reset()
        for i in range(10):
            result = env.step(TravelProAction(message=f"Client {client_id}, step {i}"))
        return client_id, result.observation.message_length

# Run 4 episodes concurrently
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
    results = list(executor.map(run_episode, range(4)))
```

## Development & Testing

### Direct Environment Testing

Test the environment logic directly without starting the HTTP server:

```bash
# From the server directory
python3 server/travel_pro_environment.py
```

This verifies that:
- Environment resets correctly
- Step executes actions properly
- State tracking works
- Rewards are calculated correctly

### Running Locally

Run the server locally for development:

```bash
uvicorn server.app:app --reload
```
